This is Tic Tac Toe Python game :

1- I Wrote function to print The Board, 	Note: that index only show here.

                                7  | 8 | 9 
                                ----------
                                4  | 5 | 6
                                ----------
                                1  | 2 | 3 


2- I Wrote a function called player_input to assign their marker as 'X' or 'O'

3- I Wrote a function called palce_marker takes the board  as a list object, a marker ('X' or 'O'), and a desired position (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board. 	 Note: this used for testing 

4- I Wrote a function called win_check to check if that player has a mark 'X' or 'O' has won.

5- I Wrote a function called choose_first to randomly decide which player goes first.

6- I Wrote a function called space_check to check a space on the board is freely available to play in it or busy (played in it).

7- I Wrote a function called full_board_check to checks if the board is full or not.

8- I Wrote a function called player_choice to check if the player choose right place and see if that space available to play in it or not.

9- I Wrote a function called replay that asks the player if they want to play again. 

10 - I use while loop to start the game.
