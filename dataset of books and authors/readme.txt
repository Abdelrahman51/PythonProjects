This is application for how to grapping data from websites by webscraping

This is website link : 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=zg_bs_pg_2?ie=UTF8&pg=1'

we need to grapping the name of books and his authors by webscrapping library.
sometimes websites automatically blocked webscraping,
if the website is updating probably this application not running.

if we see number of books = 100     And therefore number of authors = 100.

if we wrote <<books>> we will see all name of books
if we wrote <<authors>> we will see all name of authors arranged with number of books
